While I was working on one the project, I couldnâ€™t find desired Spotify API calls. At that time I was looking for the following: 
**1)** Search function which will deliver **Artist Name**, **song name**, **song ID**, **external URL** is handy to listen for a whole song, **explicit** has two values True or False, **preview** gives you 30 seconds to listen a song and a cover **image** for the specific song. 
**2)** All of the above plus the audio features for the searched songs. Audio features contain acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness etc. The audio features you can use to create visualizations and to predict nearest neighbours to the desired songs. 
**3)** I was requested to create a predicting model in order to get the desired amount of similar songs. The model had to use audio features to suggest similar songs.
All of the results had to be in a nice readable json format for the back end team to use.

### Register Spotify for Developers account
Before getting into the code you need to register an account at [Spotify for Developer](https://developer.spotify.com) and create an app in order to get **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys. In edit settings add **Redirect URIs**. I added http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback/ and https://sp-search.herokuapp.com/callback/. 

{: .box-note}
**Note:** You need to change URIs to your own localhost and to the host you will deploy your APIs to.

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

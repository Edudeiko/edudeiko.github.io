title: Miami-Dade County Open Data Hub
---

Recently I have discovered [**Miami-Dade County open data hub**](https://gis-mdc.opendata.arcgis.com).
The great thing is the datasets are constantly updating and some of them are realy fresh. Some of the data comes with the coordinates so you can use it as an advantage to create an interesting story for your next project.

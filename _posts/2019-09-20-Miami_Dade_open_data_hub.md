title: Open data hub -- Miami-Dade
---

Recently I have discovered [Miami-Dade county open data hub](https://gis-mdc.opendata.arcgis.com).
The datasets are constantly updating. Some of the data comes with the coordinates so you can use it as an advantage to create an interesting story for your next project.

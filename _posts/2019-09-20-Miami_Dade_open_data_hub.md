Recently I've discovered [**Miami-Dade County open data hub**](https://gis-mdc.opendata.arcgis.com).
The data are constantly updating and it is free to download in different formats. Some of the data comes with the coordinates so you can use it as an advantage to create an interesting story for your next project.

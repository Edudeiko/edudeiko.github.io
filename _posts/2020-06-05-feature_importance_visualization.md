I explored feature importance visualization using the heart disease dataset, which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).
My final project can be read on [Medium](https://medium.com/@evgeniy.dudeyko/creating-the-models-to-predict-a-heart-disease-with-the-features-importances-visualization-5542c447e99f).
If you're more interested in seeing the source code, please visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Edudeiko/DS-Unit-2-Applied-Modeling/blob/master/E_D_heart__disease_prediction.ipynb).
I've also deployed the project [here](https://heartdiseasepredictionbyed.herokuapp.com). Please be patient, though—the Heroku app takes a bit of time to load. :)

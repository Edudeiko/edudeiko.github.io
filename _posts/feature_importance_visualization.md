Original dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
You can read the project [here](https://medium.com/@evgeniy.dudeyko/creating-the-models-to-predict-a-heart-disease-with-the-features-importances-visualization-5542c447e99f)
Or if you are more interested in seing the source code, please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/Edudeiko/DS-Unit-2-Applied-Modeling/blob/master/E_D_heart__disease_prediction.ipynb)
Also I've deployed the project [here](https://heartdiseasepredictionbyed.herokuapp.com). Please be patient though, heroku app takes a bit time to load.
